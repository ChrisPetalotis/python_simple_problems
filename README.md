# Python Simple Problems

In this repo I am going to upload my solutions to python problems I work on. I am doing that for practice, to improve my understanding of python and acquire some experience building python applications.

Each folder will be a different 'project' and will contain at least a README file and a .py file which will contain my code to solve the problem at hand.
